# ML-Steganography-Classifier
A Python-based project for detecting **stego images** (images with hidden data) versus **clean images** using machine learning.   The program extracts multiple image features (color histograms, HOG features, brightness, and saturation) and trains a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier to classify new images as either **clean** or **stego**.
